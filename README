# rememo: Document Query Assistant

Welcome to `rememo`, a Streamlit-based demo project that showcases the capabilities of the newly released beta API from OpenAI, known as `assistant`. `rememo` stands for "Remember Memo" and is designed to act as your personal assistant for querying documents.

## Features

-   **Document Upload**: Easily upload your documents to the assistant.
-   **Question-Based Queries**: After uploading the document, you can ask specific questions and the assistant will provide answers based on the content of the document.
-   **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit to interact with the assistant seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started with `rememo`, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies.
